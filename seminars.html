Hearing personal stories and participating in group discussions provides the opportunity to deal constructively with our spoken and unspoken concerns. During the second half of the session, participants are introduced to the excellent resource provided by <strong><i>The Conversation Project</i></strong> and trained in how to use it to promote dialog with their loved ones.</p>

We suggest a process of giving and receiving forgiveness and of creating a personal, individualized spiritual blessing. We wrap up by discussing the practical and logistical issues we encounter after a loved one has died, such as making funeral and burial arrangements.</p>
