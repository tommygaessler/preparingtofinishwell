Hearing personal stories and participating in group discussions provides the opportunity to deal constructively with our spoken and unspoken concerns. During the second half of the session, participants are introduced to the excellent resource provided by <strong><i>The Conversation Project</i></strong> and trained in how to use it to promote dialog with their loved ones.</p>
